Edit the notebook to run Nemo on a notebook using Pytorch kightening without any external command or extra requirments.


## Nemo with PyTorch Lightning
PyTorch Lightning is a light weight PyTorch wrapper that reduces the engineering boilerplate and resources required to implement state-of-the-art AI. Organizing PyTorch code with Lightning, enables seamless training on multiple-GPUs, TPUs, CPUs as well as the use of difficult to implement best practices such as model sharding, 16-bit precision and more. PyTorch Lightning support an extremly robust ecosystem of Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects from 1st Party Repos such as Flash to 3rd party frameworks such as Nvidia NeMo. NVIDIA NeMo is a conversational AI toolkit built for researchers working on automatic speech recognition (ASR), natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech synthesis (TTS). The primary objective of NeMo is to help researchers from industry and academia to reuse prior work (code and pretrained models and make it easier to create new conversational AI models.
